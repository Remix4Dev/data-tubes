# Connecting the data tubes - APIs, csvs, and things in between
code to connect data silos/move data from one format to another/display using google charts API

# Google charts code source
This code was automatically exported from code.google.com/p/googlecharttools-php and ported because I wanted to fork/document what I've done with this. Happy to relinquish ownership back to original creator if they want it (may be abandoned as it was last updated in 2012).
